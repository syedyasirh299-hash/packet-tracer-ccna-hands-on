# Packet Tracer CCNA Hands-On Labs

This repository is a **hands-on collection of Cisco Packet Tracer lab exercises** designed for CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) certification preparation and general networking practice. It contains real simulation files that allow learners to explore, configure, and troubleshoot networking scenarios using Cisco’s Packet Tracer tool. This repo is ideal for students, network enthusiasts, and self-learners who want a structured, practical way to improve their networking skills. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 📌 What This Project Is About

CCNA certification requires both theoretical knowledge *and* practical skills. This project focuses on giving learners **real practice** with the exact kinds of tasks and configurations you’ll see in labs. Each `.pkt` file represents a lab that you can open in Packet Tracer, configure devices, verify connectivity, and troubleshoot issues.

This project will help you:
- Understand key networking concepts by doing real configurations.
- Build confidence in Cisco CLI (Command Line Interface) and device management.
- Review and practice labs multiple times to solidify learning.
- Track your progress day by day with labeled lab files.

The goal is to make learning **interactive, practical, and project-oriented** rather than just theoretical. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
