# Packet Tracer CCNA Hands-On Labs

This repository contains a **hands-on collection of Cisco Packet Tracer lab exercises** designed for CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) practice. These labs are made to help you **build and reinforce key networking skills** through real simulation files that you can open and configure in Cisco Packet Tracer. Packet Tracer is a visual network simulation tool that lets learners create and test network topologies and configurations without needing physical hardware. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 📋 Topics Covered in This Repository

This project includes `.pkt` simulation files that focus on essential networking topics from the CCNA curriculum. These topics give you a practical foundation in modern networking:

- **Basic Networking:** IP addressing, subnetting, and network topology setup — the fundamental concepts of how networks communicate.
- **Routing:** Static routing and dynamic routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP — used to direct traffic between different networks. 
- **Switching:** VLANs, trunking, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), and EtherChannel — technologies that help segment and organize network traffic. 
- **Security:** Access Control Lists (ACLs), port security, and DHCP snooping — essentials for protecting and controlling network access. 
- **WAN Technologies:** Concepts of wide area network connectivity and networking between distant sites. 
- **IPv6 Networking:** IPv6 addressing and basic routing — modern network addressing beyond IPv4.
- **Network Services:** Core services such as DHCP, DNS, NAT, and logging — services that make networks functional and maintainable.
